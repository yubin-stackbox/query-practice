# Query Practice Solutions
This repository contains solutions to SQL query challenges from platforms such as **LeetCode** and **StrataScratch** (with more to come in the future). The focus is not only on solving the problems but also on writing **optimized, readable, and maintainable code**.  
<br>

## âœ¨ Highlights  
- **Clear & Structured Solutions**: Prioritize readability without sacrificing efficiency.  
- **Performance-Oriented**: Where relevant, solutions are optimized for execution time and scalability.  
- **Learning-Oriented**: Complex topics are broken down into approachable explanations outside the codebase.  
<br>

## ðŸš€ How to Use  
1. Browse to the platform directory of interest.  
2. Open the corresponding `.sql` file for the query solution.  
3. For extended explanations of concepts, check the linked Notion page.  
<br>

## ðŸ“– Philosophy  
The aim is to treat query challenges as an opportunity to practice **problem-solving with intent**:  
- Write code that is easy to understand for others (and future self).  
- Consider efficiency as an integral part of the solution.  
- Reflect on the underlying concepts and document them when necessary.
